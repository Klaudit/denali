 * # Models in Denali
 *
 * Denali makes no assumptions about what kind of database / ORM you might use.
 * You are free to use any you'd like, you'll just need to include a small
 * adapter class so that Denali knows how to talk to your models.
 *
 * For details, see the "Working with Databases" guide.
